## My process

In this challenge, I focused on understanding the design, identifying its component elements, and applying best practices with the knowledge and help of resources. These were the key steps I followed:

- Reading the challenge and reviewing the design

I analyzed the layout and required interactions (such as hover and focus effects).

- HTML Structure

I wrote the HTML using semantic tags and the BEM methodology for a clear and accessible structure.

- CSS Styles

I started with a mobile-first approach using Flexbox.
I focused on size consistency.
I added transition effects to buttons and links for hover and focus states.

- Testing and Validation

I tested the display on different screen sizes.
I validated the HTML and CSS to ensure there were no errors.
I checked basic accessibility with tools like the browser inspector.

- Publishing

I uploaded the project to GitHub and deployed the final version using GitHub Pages.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology 


### What I learned

- During this project, I delved deeper into the use of Flexbox, especially for centering elements and arranging them both horizontally and vertically. I struggled with getting everything aligned properly at first, but thanks to the help of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, I was able to better understand how properties like justify-content, align-items, and gap work.

- I also reinforced the use of pseudo-classes like :hover and CSS transitions, which allowed me to add visual interactivity in a smooth and professional manner.

- I implemented a mobile-first approach to ensure the design looked good on small screens, and learned how to control the maximum width (max-width) to prevent content from breaking at large or small resolutions.

- Finally, I'm starting to familiarize myself with GitHub, learning how to create repositories, upload my projects, and publish live sites. This challenge really helped me connect practice with theory.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<section></section>
<blockquote><blockquote>
```
```css
.learned-this-css {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  display: block;
  list-style: none;
}
```


### Continued development

Although I managed to complete the project, there are still several areas where I want to continue improving:

- Flexbox: It helped me a lot in this project, but I want to master it better, especially when combining it with other design systems like CSS Grid.

- Responsive Design: I'm still struggling with getting everything to adapt well to different screen sizes, so I'll continue practicing media queries and more flexible layouts.

- Semantics in HTML: I'm still struggling with correctly choosing the most appropriate tags for each piece of content. I want to learn how to better structure HTML to improve accessibility and content meaning.

- Using GitHub: I'm learning how to create and upload projects, but I want to improve my workflow with branches, more organized commits, and team collaboration.

- Animations and Transitions: I'm interested in continuing to practice visual effects to bring sites to life without cluttering the interface.

- My goal is to take steps to write cleaner, more accessible, and well-structured code.
